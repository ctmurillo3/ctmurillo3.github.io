This is a post for my computer science class

Hello everyone my name is Christian Murillo. I am 17 years old and I turn 18 on November 1st, 2025. I have three siblings and their ages are 15, 13, and 11. I attend Stratford High School and I am a senior. I am involved in orchestra and academy of science and engineering as my extracurricular activities and I used to play soccer for the school's team and on a club team. In my free time at home I like to play video games and hang out with my friends and family. I have good grades at school and I have applied to a few collges. Applying is very time consuming so I did most of my applications during the summer so that I would not have to do them during the school year.

Anyways that was 150 words so bye guys
